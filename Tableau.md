# Tableau Visualizations

For further analysis and visualization of the COVID-19 data, Tableau has been utilized to create visualizations including:

- **U.S Total Death Percent**: A visualization showing the total death percentage in the United States.
- **Total Death per Continent**: A bar chart illustrating the total death count per continent.
- **Percent Population Infected per Country**: A map visualization displaying the percentage of population infected per country.
- **Average Percent of Population Infected**: A line chart showing the average percentage of population infected over time.

You can find a visualization created using Tableau [Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/remigius.ufomba/viz/covidproject1_17085647978130/COVIDPROJECTDASHBOARD) directory. The visualization provides additional insights into the COVID-19 data and complements the SQL analysis in this portfolio.
